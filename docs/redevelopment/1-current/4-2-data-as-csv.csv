Data model compatibility,3,Uses RDF, which supports any data structure,3,,3,Contains equivalents for the core Scratchpads models and more. Data models can be extended with RDF-like triples using DataAttribute,1,Provides specimen and taxonomy models, but not biblio or SPM,2,No apparent literature data model. Core data models are not flexible, custom data will require development of new modules.,3,RDF-based
