Placeholder for Drupal 9/10 platform prototyping for Scratchpads.

This won't follow the same concept as before, whereby one full drupal stack instance per site.

Instead: one single instance for all sites.

Partition sites using Drupal Groups module.

Unfair to extent to attribute roadmap blockers to Drupal 7 itself, when the multisite configuration mandating 1000+ sites to be maintained is a significant issue. Could be the similar case if any software stack arranged like that.
