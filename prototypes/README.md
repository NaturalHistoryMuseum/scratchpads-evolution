multi-site - prototypes for proposed solutions to run all scratchpads sites together. Primary goals: massively reduce deployment by having a single full codebase stack for deployment rather than over 1000 separate full stack instances of the codebase. This will speed up releases, reduce server load. Equally important: single codebase offers opportunity for linked open data, because site experiences are closer together on one codebase.

To begin with the multi-site prototypes will resemble a single site because we would start of by proof of concept on one site then scale up.
